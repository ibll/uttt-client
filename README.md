# Controls

Everything should be decently self-explanatory. All functionality is exposed to the mouse and is just point and click, with the scroll wheel used for navigating screens. Those playing on controller or Picotron's keyboard-controller mappings can refer to the following (button descriptions for an Xbox controller):

Navigate with
- Controller Left stick / Right stick / D-pad
- Keyboard WASD / Arrows / HJKL (Vim-like)
- Mouse cursor

Select with
- Controller A
- Keyboard C or Z
- Mouse left

Go back or zoom out with
- Controller B / X
- Keyboard F / X / V

Toggle between default focus & left panel with
- Controller Y
- Keyboard G

Page up and down with
- Controller Left bumper / Right bumper
- Keyboard Q / E
- Mouse wheel up / down
- Moving up or down with default navigation, in most menus

Backspace with
- Controller X
- Keyboard X / V
